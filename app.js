// Initialize game:
//   Set initial pet states (hunger, happiness, energy) to default values
//   Display initial pet states to the user

// Set up event listeners for player actions:
//   When "Feed" button is clicked:
//     Increase pet's hunger state by a fixed amount
//     Update pet's hunger display
//     Check if pet's hunger is at maximum level (win condition)

//   When "Play" button is clicked:
//     Increase pet's happiness state by a fixed amount
//     Update pet's happiness display
//     Check if pet's happiness is at maximum level (win condition)

//   When "Rest" button is clicked:
//     Increase pet's energy state by a fixed amount
//     Update pet's energy display
//     Check if pet's energy is at maximum level (win condition)

// Set up game loop to run periodically:
//   Decrease pet's hunger state by a small amount
//   Decrease pet's happiness state by a small amount
//   Decrease pet's energy state by a small amount
//   Update pet states display

//   Check if any pet state is at minimum level (loss condition)
//     If so, display "Game Over" message and stop the game loop

//   Repeat the game loop after a fixed interval

// Check for win condition:
//   If pet's hunger, happiness, and energy states are all at maximum level:
//     Display "Congratulations! Your pet is very happy!" message
//     Stop the game loop

// End of pseudocode
