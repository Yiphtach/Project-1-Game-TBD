    Game Description
    Game Name: Virtual Pet Tamagotchi
    Description: A virtual pet that players can feed, play with, and take care of. The pet has needs that must be met to keep it happy and healthy.

Core Mechanics and Features
    Pet States: The pet has different states (e.g., hunger, happiness, energy).
    Actions: Players can perform actions like feeding, playing, and resting.
    Win/Loss Conditions: The game ends if the pet's needs are not met, leading to a sad pet (loss) or a happy pet (win).
    Time-Based Events: Pet states change over time, requiring regular interaction.

Technologies Used
    HTML: Structure of the game.
    CSS: Custom styling with Flexbox/Grid for layout.
    JavaScript: Game logic and DOM manipulation.


Pseudocode:
// 1 Define the required variables used to track the state of the game.

// 2 Store cached element references.

// 3 Upon loading, the game state should be started, and a function should 
//    be called to render this game state.

// 4 The state of the game should be rendered to the user.

// 5 Handle the game over logic. 

// 6 Handle each instance of a player clicking a button with the use of a 
//    handleClick() function.

// 7 Create reset functionality.
